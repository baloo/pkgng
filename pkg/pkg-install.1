.Op Fl ygxX
.Ar <pkg-origin> <...>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used for installation of packages from a remote package
repository database. It can install multiple packages 
specified on the command-line from multiple repositories.
.Pp
If a package is found to exists in more than one package 
repository the first matching repository is the one that the
package will be first tried to be fetched from. 
.Pp
If fetching from the repository fails for some reason the next
repository, which the package is found to exist is the one that is
tried until the package is fetched, or all repositories are tried.
.Pp
Multiple package repositories is activated only when the environment
variable \fBPACKAGESITE\fP is not defined.
.Pp
If \fBPACKAGESITE\fP is defined then only the repository to which it
points is the one that is used during the package installations.
.Pp
